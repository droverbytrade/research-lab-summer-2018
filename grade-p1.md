To successfully complete the class, you must meet the following requirements. In the first semester (Summer 2018), you

* present an empirical study on a specific topic in child or youth development that you want to replicate in your research project,
* write a proposal summarizing your research question, theoretical background, and analytical approach.

In the second semester (Winter 2018), you

* present a progress report on your research project in class,
* write a research report along with documentation to reproduce your project.

In addition, there will be homework assignments designed to facilitate successful class completion. Although these assignments aren't graded, I highly recommend to work through them within the appropriate time period in order to regularly review and practice class contents. In some cases, the homework is also immediately related to the class requirements outlined above. Homework 1 contains information on how to find an appropriate empirical study for replication. For details on the content and structure of the presentation of your empirical study, see Homework 8. In Homework 10 you'll find instructions for writing the research proposal.

### Research project
In your research project, you replicate an existing empirical study on child or youth development in whole or in part. The primary goal is to competently carry out some or all of the empirical analyses in the study, to appropriately motivate the analyses, and to document your project workflow so that it can be understood and reproduced by anyone who has access to the original data. An exceptional research project additionally extends the original analysis in a meaningful way, for example, by

* looking at children at a different age,
* exploring group differences,
* investigating the mechanisms underlying some statistical relation,
* using additional or alternative control variables,
* applying alternative statistical methods.

The final report should emulate an empirical article in a typical social science journal. Guidelines and techniques for project documentation will be discussed and applied as the class progresses. I'll provide more details on the structure, layout, and grading of the report at the beginning of next semester.

### Bonus points
You can improve your final grade by one decimal increment (e.g., from 1.7 to 1.3 or from 3.0 to 2.7) by adequately answering a total of 10 questions posted by your classmates on Piazza, an online platform for class Q&A (see class resources below). For your answer to count towards your grade it must completely solve the initial query, including follow-up questions and clarifications, within 24 hours of the first post. Answers to trivial questions (e.g., "When is Homework 1 due?" or "Where do I find the slides?") don't qualify in this context. This bonus point policy is subject to review after the first semester.

### Workload
Upon successful completion of the class you are awarded 15 credit points, which equals a total workload of 450 units Ã  45 minutes. Per semester, there are only 60 units (i.e., 3 hours/week) of class time. The remaining 165 units per semester (i.e., roughly 8 hours/week) are allotted to preparing and reviewing class contents, including homework assignments, reading, writing etc. Therefore, please schedule sufficient time outside of class hours.

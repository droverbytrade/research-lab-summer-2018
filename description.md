## Course content
In this two-part research lab participants carry out their own research project in the area of child and youth development. Topics include sex differences in behavioral problems and cognitive skills, the relation between poverty and children's development or between maternal smoking and birth weight, and many more. During the first semester, participants choose a topic and start preparing the data for their analysis. The second semester is mainly devoted to data analysis and writing a research report.

A key goal of the course is to establish a workflow for *transparent* and *reproducible* empirical social research (on any topic). To this end, the course discusses in detail how to prepare research data (e.g., merging data sets, recoding variables, constructing analytical samples), how to efficiently  produce formatted research output (e.g., tables and figures), and, most importantly, how to rigorously document these tasks so that others (including your future self!) can understand and repeat each step of the research process and build on your work.

### Q&A on Piazza

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

Find our class page at:  
<https://piazza.com/uni-koeln.de/spring2018/specialisationmodulei/home>

Piazza is also available costfree as an app for Android and iOS.

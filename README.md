# Reproducible research on child and youth development

University of Cologne
Summer and Winter 2018

## Course description
This two-part research lab provides an introduction to social research on child and youth development. It deals with topics such as sex differences in behavioral and cognitive skills, the relation between poverty and children's development, or maternal smoking on birth weight. A key goal of the course is to provide routines and techniques to do empirical social research that is reproducible by others with hands-on guidance for (1) setting up a research project, (2) preparing the empirical data and (3) documenting the empirical analyses and their results in a transparent manner.

This is a research lab within the M.Sc. program [Sociology and Empirical Social Research](https://www.wiso.uni-koeln.de/en/studies/master/master-sociology-and-social-research/) at the University of Cologne, Germany. It stretches over two semesters with the aim to train students to carry out their own research project from formulating a research question to writing a summary report.
